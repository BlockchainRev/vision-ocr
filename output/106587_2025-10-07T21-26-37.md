However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that all or any of those payments be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank cheek, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.

Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 14. Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall

# Application of Payments or Proceeds
relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.

## Application of Payments or Proceeds
Except as otherwise described in this Security Instrument or the Note, all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority:

* First, to the Mortgage Insurance premiums to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or the monthly charge by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premiums;
* Second, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and other hazard insurance premiums, as required;
* Third, to interest due under the Note;
* Fourth, to amortization of the principal of the Note; and,
* Fifth, to late charges due under the Note.

Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount of the Periodic Payments.

## Funds for Escrow Items
Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the “Funds”) to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property, if any; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums to be paid by Lender to the Secretary instead of the monthly Mortgage Insurance premiums. These items are called “Escrow Items.” At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that dues and assessments be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay to Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower’s obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower’s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower’s obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase “covenant and agreement” is used in Section 9. If Borrower fails to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to any waiver, and Borrower then fails to make payment of the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount.

---

# Lender and Borrower Agreement

Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 14 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section. Borrower shall, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.

The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.

If there is a surplus of funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments.

Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.

## 4. Charges; Liens

Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to the Property which can be attained prior to the Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.

Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending.

---

# 5. Property Insurance
Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences may change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification, and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.

If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable to Lender with such interest, at Lender's option.

All insurance policies required by Lender shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies as received from Borrower requesting payment. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.

# In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, if the restoration or repair of the Property, if economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

## 2. 
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.

## 6. Occupancy
Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that this requirement shall cause undue hardship for the Borrower or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.

## 7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections
Borrower shall not destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or

# 8. Borrower's Loan Application
Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.

## 9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument
If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or foreclosure, or enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but are not limited to: 
- paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument;
- appearing in court; and 
- paying reasonable attorney's fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including securing a position in a tax or other lien proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate

---

# 10. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture
All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.

If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.

In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to borrower.

## Montco

In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.

If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.

Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender's judgment, could result in foreclosure of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 18, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's judgment, precludes foreclosure of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender's interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied

## 11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver
Extension of the time for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.

## 12. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound
Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note ("a Co-signer") is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the Co-signer's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the

# 13. Loan Charges
Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.

If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment with no changes in the date due or the monthly payment unless the Note holder agrees in writing to those changes. Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.

## 14. Notices
All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this

# 15. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction
This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.

As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.

## 16. Borrower's Copy
Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.

## 17. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower
As used in this Section 17, "Interest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower to a purchaser.

If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.

If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 14 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.

## 18. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration
If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall have the right to reinstatement of a mortgage. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable

---

# 19. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance

The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the “Loan Servicer”) that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also may be one or more changes which will not state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.

Neither Borrower nor any successor in title may consent, join in, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual litigant or a member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 14) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the

# 20. Borrower Not Third-Party Beneficiary to Contract of Insurance
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Borrower is not a third-party beneficiary to the contract of insurance between Lender and the Secretary, and is not entitled to enforce any agreement between Lender and the Secretary, unless explicitly authorized to do so by Applicable Law.

## 21. Hazardous Substances
As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) "Environmental Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.

Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential use and maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).

Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.

---

# NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS
Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:

## Acceleration; Remedies
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section 17 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). Lender shall notify Borrower of, among other things: (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) when the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default as specified may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale of the Property. Lender shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to assert in the foreclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and foreclosure. If the default is not cured by this Security Instrument as specified, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

## Release
23. Release. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, this Security Instrument and the estate conveyed shall terminate and become void. After such occurrence, Lender shall discharge and satisfy this Security Instrument. Borrower shall pay any recordation costs. Lender may charge Borrower a fee for releasing this Security Instrument, but only if the fee is paid to a third party for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable Law.

## Waivers
24. Waivers. Borrower, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives and releases any error or defects in proceedings to enforce this Security Instrument, and hereby waives the benefit of any present or future laws providing for stay of execution, extension of time, exemption from attachment, levy and sale, and homestead exemption.

## Reinstatement Period
25. Reinstatement Period. Borrower's time to reinstate provided in Section 18 shall extend to one hour prior to the commencement of bidding at a sheriff's sale or other sale pursuant to this Security Instrument.

## Purchase Money Mortgage
26. Purchase Money Mortgage. If any of the debt secured by this Security Instrument is lent to Borrower to acquire title to the Property, this Security Instrument shall be a purchase money mortgage.

## Representations and Covenants

If my representations and covenants in Section 1 continue to be true in all material respects, then this Modification Agreement (“Agreement”) will, as set forth in Section 3, amend and supplement (1) the Security Instrument on the Property, and (2) the Promissory Note secured by the Security Instrument (the “Loan Documents”). Except for “Subordinate Security Instrument” and “Subordinate Note”, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have meaning given to them in Loan Documents.

I understand that after I sign and return the Subordinate Note, Subordinate Security Instrument, and two copies of this Agreement to the Lender, the Lender will send me a signed copy of this Agreement. This Agreement will not take effect unless the preconditions set forth in Section 2 have been satisfied.

### My Representations and Covenants

I certify, represent to Lender, covenant and agree:

1. 
A. I am experiencing a financial hardship, and as a result, (i) I am in default under the Loan Documents or my default is imminent, and (ii) I do not have sufficient income or access to sufficient liquid assets to cure the default or to make the monthly mortgage payments now or in the near future;  
B. The Property has not been condemned;  
C. There has been no impermissible change in the ownership of the Property since I signed the Loan Documents. A permissible change would be any transfer that the Lender is required by law to allow, such as a transfer to add or remove a family member, spouse or domestic partner of the undersigned in the event of a death, divorce or marriage;  
D. Under penalty of perjury, all documents and information I have provided to Lender in connection with this Agreement, including the documents and information regarding my eligibility for the Program, are true and correct; and

# Loan Number 707843157

## Acknowledgements and Preconditions to Modification
I understand and acknowledge that:

A. If prior to the Modification Effective Date as set forth in Section 3 the Lender determines that any of my representations in Section 1 are no longer true and correct or any covenant in Section 1 has not been performed, the Loan Documents will not be modified, this Agreement will terminate, and the Subordinate Note and Subordinate Security Instrument will not be in effect. In that event, the Lender will have all of the rights and remedies provided by the Loan Documents; and

B. I understand that the Loan Documents will not be modified unless (i) the Lender accepts this Agreement by signing and returning a copy of it to me, and (ii) the Modification Effective Date (as defined in Section 3) has occurred. I further understand and agree that the Lender will not be obligated or bound to make any modification of the Loan Documents if I fail to meet any one of the requirements under this Agreement.

## The Modification
If my representations and covenants in Section 1 continue to be true in all material respects and all prerequisites to the modification set forth in Section 2 have been met, the Loan Documents will automatically become modified on DECEMBER 01, 2024 (the "Modification Effective Date") and all unpaid late charges that remain unpaid to the Lender but not previously waived.

A. The Maturity Date will be: NOVEMBER 01, 2064.

B. The current Total Outstanding Balance of my loan includes all unpaid principal and amounts that will be past due as of the Modification Effective Date. The current Total Outstanding Balance of my Original Note includes unpaid principal, unpaid and deferred interest, projected escrow shortages, escrow advances and other costs, but excludes Outstanding Balance of my Original Note and is $400,321.78. The current Total Outstanding Balance of my loan is $400,321.78.

C. The Total Outstanding Balance will be reduced by $7,401.80. This amount will be included in a new, non-interest bearing Subordinate Note ("Subordinate Note"), payable to HUD, and will not be due until the Original Note is paid off, matures, or I sell the property, whichever is earliest.

D. The Total Outstanding Balance less the amount of the Subordinate Note, or $393,119.08, will be the New Principal Balance of my Original Note. Interest at the rate of 6.3750% will begin to accrue on the New Principal Balance as of NOVEMBER 01, 2024 and the first new monthly payment on the New Principal Balance will be due on DECEMBER 01, 2024.

My payment schedule for the modified Loan is as follows:

| Years | Interest Rate | Interest Rate Change Date | Monthly Principal and Interest Payment Amount | Estimated Monthly M&I Escrow Payment Amount | Total Monthly Payment* | Payment Begins On | Number of Monthly Payments |

| 40    | 6.3750%      | 11-01-2024               | $2,266.63                                      | $1,366.62                                  | $3,633.25               | 12-01-2024        | 480                        |

*The escrow payments may be adjusted periodically in accordance with applicable law and therefore my total monthly payment may change accordingly.

The above terms in this Section 3.D. shall supersede any provisions to the contrary in the Loan Documents, including but not limited to, provisions for an adjustable, step or simple interest rate or for a graduated or growing-equity payment schedule.

I understand that, if I have a pay option adjustable rate mortgage loan, upon modification, no longer be offered and that the monthly payments described in the above payment schedule for my modified Loan will be the minimum payment that will be due each month for the remaining term of the Loan. My modified Loan will not have a negative amortization feature that would allow me to pay less on the interest due resulting in any unpaid interest being added to the outstanding principal balance.

E. I will be in default if I do not comply with the terms of the Loan Documents, as modified by this Agreement.

F. If a default rate of interest is permitted under the Loan Documents, then in the event of default under the Loan Documents, as amended, the interest that will be due will be the rate set forth in Section 3.D.

G. I agree to pay in full the Subordinate Note and any other amounts still owed under the Loan Documents by the earliest of: (i) the date I sell or transfer an interest in the Property, (ii) the date I pay all amounts due and owing under the Original Note, including any subsequent modifications to the Original Note, or (iii) the new Maturity Date set forth in Section 3.A. above.

## Additional Agreements

I agree to the following:

A. That all persons who signed the Loan Documents or their authorized representative(s) have signed this Agreement, the Subordinate Note, and the Subordinate Security Instrument, unless (i) borrower or co-borrower is deceased; (ii) the borrower and co-borrower are divorced and the property has been transferred to one spouse in the divorce decree, the spouse who no longer has an interest in the property need not sign this Agreement (although the non-signing spouse may continue to be held liable for the

## Terms and Conditions of the Loan

The following terms and conditions are outlined:

### Modifications to Loan Agreement

B. That this Agreement, the Subordinate Note, and the Subordinate Security Instrument shall supersede the terms of any modification, forbearance, trial period plan or other workout plan that I previously entered into with Lender.

C. To comply, except to the extent that they are modified by this Agreement, the Subordinate Note, and the Subordinate Security Instrument, with all covenants, agreements, requirements of the Loan Documents including my agreement to make all payments of taxes, insurance, premiums, assessments, Escrow items, impounds, and all other payments, the amount of which may change periodically over the term of my Loan.

D. That this Agreement constitutes notice that the Lender's waiver as to payment of Escrow funds, if any, has been revoked, and I have been advised of the amount needed to fully fund my escrow account.

E. That the Loan Documents as modified by this Agreement are duly valid, binding agreements, enforceable in accordance with their terms and are hereby reaffirmed. The Loan Documents constitute a first lien on the Property and are in no way prejudiced by this Agreement.

F. That all terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, except as expressly modified by this Agreement, the Subordinate Note, and the Subordinate Security Instrument, remain in full force and effect; nothing in this Agreement or the Subordinate Note, or the Subordinate Security Instrument shall be understood or construed to be a satisfaction or release in whole or in part of the obligations provided for in, and as otherwise specifically modified by, this Agreement, the Subordinate Note, and the Subordinate Security Instrument, the Lender and I will be bound by, and will comply with, all of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.

G. That the mortgage insurance premiums on my loan may increase and the date on which I may request cancellation of mortgage insurance may change as a result of this loan modification.

H. That, as of the Modification Effective Date, notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents, if all or any part of the Property or any interest in it is sold or transferred without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by the Security Instrument. Lender shall not exercise this option if state or federal law rules or regulations prohibit the exercise of such option as of the date of such sale or transfer. If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give me notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is delivered or mailed within which I must pay all sums secured by the Subordinate Security Instrument. If I fail to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by the Security Instrument without further notice or demand on me.

I. That, as of the Modification Effective Date, I understand that the Lender will only allow the transfer and assumption of the Loan, including this Agreement, to a transferee of my

## Terms and Conditions

property as permitted under the Gam St. Germain Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1701j-3. A buyer or transferee of the Property will not be permitted, under any other circumstance, to assume the Loan. Except as noted herein, this Agreement may not be assigned to, or assumed by, a buyer or transferee of the Property.

## Modification Effective Date and Original Note

J. That, as of the Modification Effective Date, if any provision in the Original Note or in any addendum or amendment to the Original Note, allowing for a penalty for full or partial prepayment of the Original Note, such provision is null and void.

K. That, I will cooperate fully with Lender in obtaining any title endorsement(s), or similar title insurance product(s), and/or subordination agreement(s) that are necessary or required by the Lender's procedures to ensure that the modified mortgage Loan is in first lien position and/or is fully enforceable upon modification and that, under no circumstance and not withstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Lender does not receive such title endorsement(s), title insurance product(s) and/or subordination agreement(s), then the terms of this Agreement will not become effective on the Modification Effective Date and the Agreement will be null and void.

L. That, if any foreclosure action against me is dismissed as a result of entering into this Agreement, I will remain liable for and bear my own attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, as permitted by applicable law.

M. That I will execute such other documents as may be reasonably necessary to either (i) consummate the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (ii) correct the terms and conditions of this Agreement if an error is detected after execution of this Agreement. I understand that either a corrected Agreement or a letter agreement containing the correction will be provided to me for my signature. At Lender's option, this Agreement will be void and of no legal effect upon notice of such error. If I elect not to sign any such corrective documentation, the terms of the original Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect, and such terms will not be modified by this Agreement, and I will not be eligible for a modification.

N. That if any document related to the Loan Documents and/or this Agreement is lost, misplaced, misstated, inaccurately reflects the true and correct terms and conditions of the Loan as modified, or is otherwise missing, I will comply with the Lender's request to execute, acknowledge, initial and deliver to the Lender any documentation the Lender deems necessary. All documents the Lender requests of me under this Section 4.N. shall be referred to as “Documents”. I agree to deliver the Documents within ten (10) days after I receive the Lender's written request for such replacement.

## Bankruptcy and Security Instrument

5. If I have been granted a discharge in bankruptcy with respect to the Original Note and Security Instrument prior to the execution of this Agreement nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to collect any discharged debt against me personally or an attempt to revive personal liability. However, I acknowledge that Lender retains certain rights, including but not limited to the right to foreclose its lien evidenced by the Security Instrument under appropriate circumstances. The parties agree that the consideration for this Agreement is Lender's forbearance from presently exercising its rights and pursuing its remedies under the Security Instrument as a result of my default thereunder.

# Security Instrument
See Exhibit "A" attached hereto and made a part hereof; 

which has the address of **8321 THOMSON RD, ELKINS PARK, PA 19027** ("Property Address");

TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements, appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be covered by this Security Instrument as the "Property".

All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the "Property".

BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seized of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to mortgage, grant, and convey the Property, and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to encumbrances of record.

THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.

## Uniform Covenants
Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:

1. **Payment of Principal**: Borrower shall pay when due the principal of the debt evidenced by the **Note**.

2. **Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver**: Extension of the time of payment of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to any successor in interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or Borrower's successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower's successors in interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.

3. **Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers**: The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower. Borrower's covenants and agreements shall be joint and several. Any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the term of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower's consent.

4. **Notices**: Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail unless Applicable Law requires use of another method. The notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to Lender. Any notice to Lender shall be given by first class mail to: **Department of Housing and Urban Development, Attention: Single Family Notes Branch, 451 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20410** or any address Lender designates by notice to Borrower. Any notice provided for in this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower or Lender when given as provided in this Instrument.

# Governing Law; Severability

5. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by Federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note are declared to be severable.

To this end the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.

## Borrower's Copy

6. Borrower's Copy. Borrow shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.

## NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS

Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:

### Acceleration; Remedies

7. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument. Lender shall notify Borrower, among other things: (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) when the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default as specified may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale of the Property. Lender shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to assert in the foreclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and foreclosure. If the default is not cured as specified, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. In pursuing remedies provided in this Section 7, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs of title evidence to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

* If the Lender's interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the Secretary requires immediate payment in full under Paragraph 4 of the Promissory Note, the Secretary may invoke the judicial power of sale provided in the Single Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1984 (“Act”) (12 U.S.C. §3751 et seq.) and requesting a foreclosure commissioner designated under the Act to commence foreclosure and to sell the Property as provided by the Act. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall deprive the Secretary of any rights otherwise available to Lender under this paragraph or Applicable Law.

8. Release. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, this Security Instrument and the Note conveyed shall terminate and become void. After such occurrence, Lender shall pay any recording costs. Lender may charge Borrower a fee for releasing this Security Instrument, but only if the fee is paid to a third party for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable Law.

9. Waivers. Borrower, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives and releases any error or defects in proceedings to enforce this Security Instrument, and hereby waives the benefit of any present or future laws providing for stay of execution, extension of time, exemption from attachment, levy or sale, and homestead exemption.

10. Reinstatement Period. Borrower's time to reinstate shall extend to one hour prior to the commencement of bidding at a sheriff's sale or other sale pursuant to this Security Instrument.

11. Bankruptcy Discharge. If Borrower, subsequent to June 6, 2023, receives discharge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and there is no valid reaffirmation agreement of the underlying debt, Lender will not attempt to re-establish any personal liability for the underlying debt.

---

# 12. Effect of Survival Events
Both before and after any Survival Event, as defined below, Borrower shall:

* (a) pay any collection expenses under Section 7 of this Security Instrument; and

Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under the Note or this Security Instrument shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.

3. **Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers**. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower. Borrower’s covenants and agreements are joint and several.

## Unreadable Text
The image contains a significant amount of handwritten text that is difficult to decipher. However, I will attempt to extract and format the visible and recognizable content.

## Extracted Text

The following sections and information are attempted to be extracted:

### Possible Headings and Signatures

- **Robert St. Claylor** (Signature)

### Unstructured Text

Due to the complexity and the handwriting's difficulty in being read, much of the text remains unextracted. The document seems to involve:

- Discussions around estates, wills, and inheritances.
- Signatures and agreements.

## Limitations
- The majority of the text is in cursive and difficult to read accurately.
- The document's condition and quality may affect the accuracy of the extracted text.
